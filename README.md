## Problem Statement
The HR department faces challenges in optimizing workforce management due to:

1.A high number of employees nearing retrenchment (8%).
2.Uneven promotion opportunities, particularly impacting critical job roles like Managers and Sales Executives.
3.Disparities in employee tenure and satisfaction, which can influence retention, engagement, and productivity.

## Insights
In a company of 1,470 employees, the HR team noticed a trend impacting their workforce optimization strategies.

### The Workforce Snapshot
The organization has a strong employee base, with 60% male and 40% female representation. However, a closer look reveals areas of concern:

Only 72 employees (4.9%) are due for promotion, while a significant 117 employees (8%) face retrenchment.
The impact is uneven across departments:
Managers are notably affected, with 44 retrenchments and only 22 promotions.
Sales Executives face 20 retrenchments, despite their large workforce of 326 employees.
Service and Performance Insights
Employees with longer tenures (e.g., 5 years and 1 year) form the largest clusters, showing growth potential. Encouragingly, 84.6% of employees maintain high performance ratings. However, the remaining 15.4% with low performance contribute to retrenchment pressures.

### The Distance to Work analysis reveals that proximity plays a role in satisfaction:

64% of employees live very close to work.
Meanwhile, 15.6% are very far away, which could influence retention and productivity.
HR leaders now face the challenge of addressing workforce imbalances, enhancing promotion opportunities, and minimizing retrenchment impacts while retaining top talent.

## Recommendations
Implement Targeted Upskilling Programs

1. Focus on at-risk job roles like Managers and Sales Executives. Provide training programs to enhance skills, productivity, and eligibility for promotions.
Address Retrenchment with Proactive Retention Plans

2. Develop intervention strategies such as mentorship programs, performance improvement plans (PIPs), and job realignment for employees identified for retrenchment.
Improve Job Satisfaction and Retention

3. Introduce flexible working arrangements, especially for employees living "very far" from work.
Recognize and reward high performers regularly to maintain engagement and motivation.
